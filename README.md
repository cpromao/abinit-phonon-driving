# phonondriving

This is a collection of MATLAB scripts which use ABINIT data (output with anaddb) to create supercells with superposed phonon amplitudes, calculate phonon-phonon coupling constants, and model IR driving of Raman active phonons.

The example given is LiB3O5 (see arXiv:2311.00824 for further explanation and doi:10.5281/zenodo.10051463 for DFT data).
